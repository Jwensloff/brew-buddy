## 💡 Learning Goals and Objectives

This was the second project for mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design. The goals included: 

- Build on our understanding of React, Router, and Cypress 
- Learn and implement Context API as a tool for global state management
- Build a complex application through an agile process

## 🏆 Wins and Challenges 
 - We were able to take on 2 new technologies to create the most complex application we have made to date.
 - We implemented a flux pattern to clean up our global state management and have a single source of truth.
 - We were able to implement Lealfet for our map component to dynamically respond to user interaction.
